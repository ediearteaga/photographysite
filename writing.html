        <h><b>Line Drawing Writing</b></h>
        <br></br>
        <p class = "big"> Lines are the basis for everything visual.  Lines inform, they tell stories, and they articulate direction and meaning.  Essentially, what a line is doing by its very nature is telling the story of a path.  However, how one interprets what tracing one’s path means is open for interpretation.  At its most simplistic and obvious level, a line creates or replicates the literal placement of something— like a map, for instance, which is what the author of "Spacial Practices" is talking about when they write that, “It is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths and their trajectories” (pg. 97).  Then, there’s the movement of an object that was moving in the moment it was being recorded by lines but is not static.  In contrast, the path of a line can be something that is not literally tracing something physical, but rather something which somehow directly references an object’s inherent path and its importance.  In my series of line drawings, I did exactly that.  I closely studied the shapes of the lines that make up my close friends’ and family members’ hair, and by realizing that those with curlier hair have struggled with being subjected to more racial discrimination throughout their lives, I was able to render thoughts about people’s journeys, AKA paths, through the line that make up the patterns of their hair.</p>

    <h><b>Color Essay</b></h>
    <br></br>
        <p class = "big">Imagine the color of the saturated sky on the hottest day of Summer.  Notice the specific, vibrant tones of the cloud-less sky.  That, indeed, is the color cyan.  Derived from the Greek word, “kyanos”, the word “cyan” is in fact rooted in the same words as the medical terms “cyanopathy” and “cyanosis”.  While it is notable that the color cyan is most commonly found in hues of the sky and/or hues of bodies of water, in the photograph from my personal archive with which I used showcases the massive cyan sky in the background of the subjects and in between the plants.  It appears ti fade from a light blue to a medium teal, from bottom to top.  I, like many others, admire this color, for it contains a rare vibrancy that often appears in the warmest days of summer in nature. </p>

    <h><b>Newspaper Artists Statement</b></h>
        <br></br>
        <p class = "big">While listening to the podcast, I noticed that the artist often spoke of the, “intense contradiction of values” and how it is often used in newspapers.  I was quite interested by the contrast between the opulence of the designer, overly-branded garments printed on these pages of excessively cheap and disposable newsprint.  I chose to parallel this contrast by using authentic Swarovski branded crystals directly adhered to the newsprint, as I was also fascinated by, “The physicality of the newspaper”.  Through this piece of art, I am posing the question, ‘why is a brand logo on a newspaper any less valuable than the brand logo on the item itself?’</p>

    <h><b>World Wide Web Response</b></h>
    <br></br>
        <p class = "big">Growing up in an age of seemingly unlimited technology, it is interesting to read about how the world wide web has astronomically grown, both in size and importance, from just a few years ago.  It is particularly ironic how the world wide web is "a pool of human knowledge", meanwhile it is really driven by the power of inanimate technology and artificial intelligence.  I have also noticed a parallel between the world wide web and "Labrynths", since Labrynths describes an ever growing library, which is practically the internet in a physical form.  </p>

    <h><b>New York Art Book Fair Response</b></h>
    <br></br>
        <p class = "big">One item for sale at the New York Art Book Fair which I particularly enjoyed was the magazine called Crybaby Zine.  I loved the cover of this magazine, as it pictured an all girl skate crew from New York City called The Skate Kitchen.  I think it is admirable that a small, independently owned local magazine would picture an all girl skate crew on its cover, as all girl skate crews are especially hard to find.  In addition, the magazine appeared to be run by mostly teens/young adults, and the cover was even shot by a 18-year-old photographer. </p>

    <h><b>Extra Credit: Artist Report</b></h>
    <br></br>
        <p class = "big">At first glance, I quite liked Rachael Gorchov’s work.  What originally caught my attention were the bright, bold, contrasting colors that she uses throughout nearly all of her pieces.  On Tuesday, November 6, 2018, artist Gorchov herself came to speak about her work as well as her fascinating life story to our NYU Visual Thinking class.  Born and raised in suburban Pennsylvania, the freeform, organic shapes that appear to be the basis of the structure of many of her artworks, paired with the bright colors, suggest a life spent outdoors in nature in a place such as suburban Pennsylvania.  When she discussed her own work to our classed, I quite enjoyed how she described the fact that her many of her pieces double as bowls.  I also thought it was impressive and fascinating that the flat figures next to her objects were originally traces from the 3D figures’ shadows. </p>
